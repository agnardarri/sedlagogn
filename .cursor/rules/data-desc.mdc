# Description of Excel data

- Assets/liabilities for various sectors and subsectors in the Icelandic economy
- Time series going back several years
- Hierarchically presented: Lines below often children of the row above. Represented by indentation
- Data often in one particular sheet
- Sheet often begins with several lines of metadata

# Strategy

- Make a YAML file that describes the structure of each file
- What's the hierarchy?
- What's the cell range of the data?
